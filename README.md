# Autonomous-line-follower-mobile-robot

A Line Follower Robot built by Arduino is a type of mobile robot that is designed to follow a pre-determined path without any human intervention, using the popular microcontroller board, Arduino. The robot is equipped with a sensor system, which detects the path and provides feedback to the control system. To ensure accurate path following, it is essential to test the sensor to confirm its functionality before proceeding.

Once the sensor is confirmed to be working correctly, the weighting scheme can be adjusted based on the sensor readings on the testing path. This is done in order to optimize the robot's ability to follow the path accurately. The PD values can also be adjusted based on the robot's performance, which helps to maintain stability and ensure that it stays on track.
