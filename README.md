A Line Follower Robot is a type of mobile robot that is designed to follow a pre-determined path without any human intervention. The key component of a Line Follower Robot is its sensor system, which is responsible for detecting the path and providing feedback to the control system. In order for the robot to follow the path accurately, it is important to ensure that the sensor is working correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to test the sensor to confirm its functionality.

Once the sensor is confirmed to be working correctly, the weighting scheme can be adjusted based on the sensor readings on the testing path. This is done in order to optimize the robot's ability to follow the path accurately. The PD values can also be adjusted based on the robot's performance, which helps to maintain stability and ensure that it stays on track.
